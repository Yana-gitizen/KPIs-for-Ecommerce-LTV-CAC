I helped a shopify store to calculate Lifetime Value (LTV) and Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) to determine profitability, optimize marketing spend, and ensure sustainable growth. 
A healthy LTV:CAC ratio (ideally 3:1) ensures that the revenue generated from a customer over time justifies the cost of acquiring them, preventing long-term financial loss. 
In more depth this ratio can be found for different products categories. The following questions can be answered from this analysis:

-Are we profitable on our first order, or do we rely on repeat purchases?

-Is our current customer acquisition strategy sustainable? 

-Which customer segments or products offer the best long-term return?

-Are we spending the right amount to acquire customers?

-Which marketing channels are driving the highest quality, most loyal customers?

-Are we losing money by over-discounting to acquire customers?
